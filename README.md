IDEA for Project :
We will be building an app which would be helpful in following way--
* We would use historical data,satellite based information/drones to create a database of assets with respect to type of infrastructure,water,sanitation facilities,access to roads and overall capacity (to accommodate people in safe places) during disasters in a flood prone region.
These data would be basically Geographic Information System(GIS) and other geolocation services based information to represent locations on a globally referenceable platform to enable mapping.

* Then with the help of open street maps/Google Earth,we will mark out the most flood prone regions and also the places that can be used as a shelter(We will give this information in the form of multiple maps).This can be accessed by people at the time of natural hazards.
 For example-Locations of road network data can be merged with the flood risk map to get a single map for identifying vulnerable road communication in flood prone areas.
 We would be basically be making Flood hazard map with the help of DEM and GIS.
 
 * We would provide a feature on our app that at the time of floods,people in need of medical facilities would be linked  to nearby hospitals.We would also like to prevent a disease/epidemic to communicate in the whole region by using Microsoft's Power BI and ArcGIS by helping agencies deliever vaccinations and medical help.
 
 * We would create a Dashboard with  helpline numbers in our app, and also help relief camps with the above features,and would also like to device a way so that all tasks can be carried out with automated suggestions (with help from historical data, on-ground reports, live weather feed).
 We would display Dashboard that displays Proximity data â€“ which team (volunteers, local authorities, Army or Navy deployed for rescue effort) is near to an area where people are stranded and/or need help. Guide those teams to that location & suggested an optimal route to take with the help of Maps.
 
 * We would provide suggestions for flood control,disease prevention which could be used in future.
